What if you could learn how to code and have fun in the process? What if kids could learn professional programming at age 8? Not coding with tiles or drop-down blocksâ€¦ but actual text-based professional software development! And not just tiny programs like how to display "Hello World" or add some math. What if they could program full video games? And what if it was all wrapped in a fun story, as a comic book, with engaging characters? Is that impossible? Or maybe it is a disruptive new way for kids to learn how to program!   

IncrediCoders Python Adventures features templates and code on GitHub, complete with quiz questions, answers, and challenges for each chapter, as well as complimentary information for students to keep learning. This is a new type of book that embraces online learning, as well as open-source engineering, and it's for kids. Give it a try and let us know how we did!
